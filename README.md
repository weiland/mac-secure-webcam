# Protect your mac by uploading webcam imgaes and sreenshots

### ToDo
- replace `~/Pictures/isight/` with your path to save the isight images
(dont use your main Pictures folder)
- replace `user@server:"pic/"` witch your username and server
(you should have set up ssh keys for a 'passwordless connection')
- it is up to you how you want to run that script (on start, via cronjob)

The **isightcapture** bin is attached to this repository.
feel free to copy it to your `/usr/sbin`
